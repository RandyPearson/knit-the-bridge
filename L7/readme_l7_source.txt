NOTE: Although the "true tip" of the L7 open source code is in a 
separate public repository (https://github.com/RandyPearson/L7-framework),
this repository contains an .\L7 folder with the version of L7
that matches the rest of the repo. Please DO NOT try pulling
the public L7 tip into this project, unless you specifically
are aware of a branch/tag matching its needs.
